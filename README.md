# Improving Value Estimation Critically Enhances Vanilla Policy Gradient

This repository contains the code and implementation details in the paper **Improving Value Estimation Critically Enhances Vanilla Policy Gradient**.

We adopt and modify the implementation from **[Tianshou](https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou)**.

For easier implemetation, we also provide a single-file codebase built from **[CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl)**. Note that we removed all non-essential components from the original implementation.
